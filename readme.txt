Welcome to the readme for my events website project needed to complete my html/css course. 

Please see below for details on how website is made.

I made this website to show the different functions that was asked to be made in our instructions for the project. This is not made to visually appealing site but rather show the different 
functions to run the site. This is a stadium theme event site.

Homepage details
- You will notice there is a welcome message along with a about us section as well

- You will notice an hero image showing the theme of the site

- This img is also a link to the events page

Events page

- There are three different events listed 

- There is also semantic elements used to make it run smoother

Menu page

- There is a table made for each category of items on the Menu

- There are header for each category 

- There are at least two rows for each category

- The table has striped rows to make it more easy to readme

Location page

- The hours and address are listed below the map

- There is a google map embedded to this page

- All content is center on page as well done in the css coding

Contact-Us page

- Build a form to gather the users personal information along with a message box for a detailed message

- Form also validates to make sure all required fields are completed before submitting

- FYI I couldn't figure out how to get the submit buttom to be place under the form on the center alignment. It worked with not centered but wanted form to be in the center of page. 
I look forward to reply to this message in feedback once submited


Nav Bar

- Same nav bar across all pages and all links worked and tested

- Link will change colors once clicked on

- There is a hover color as well for the links
